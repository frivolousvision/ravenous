# ravenous

#### This a project I did with Codecademy to develop my further skills using react.js.

This project focused on creating multiple components in order manage state and 
pass that state as props to other components. Then the app updates state via values entered 
into a search input in order to exectute a request to Yelp's APIs. The results are then 
rendered to the UI.


[A live version of this app can been seen here](http://ravenous-dan-project.surge.sh/)
