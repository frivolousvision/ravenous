# ravenous

#### This a project I did with Codecademy to develop my further skills using react.js.


This project fetches data from Yelp's API, turns the response into JSON and uses .map
to dynamically display images and information about restaurants based on provided
search terms.

The project focused on creating multiple react components in order manage state and 
pass props to other components to update the search terms for the Yelp API endpoints.


[A live version of this app can been seen here](http://ravenous-dan-project.surge.sh/)

For the fetch to work properly, a temporary server must be first activated: [here](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)
